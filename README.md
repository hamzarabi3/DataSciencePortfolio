**This repo contains two-mini projects that I worked on while taking the course on machine learning with Python by IBM.**
1. Simple Classification with KNN, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression
2. Crack detection in concrete images with transfer learning of VGG-16 and resnet-50 models built in tensorflow.
